		<h4>The Rejuvenate Cosmetic Clinic, offer Dermal Filler (Restylane subQ &amp; Juvederm Volumma) injection for cheek enhancement.</h4>
<p>Cheek enhancements may be desirable either to improve the definition over the cheek bones or to lift the mid face as part of facial rejuvenation. Restylane SubQ/ Juvederm Volumma Dermal Filler are alternatives to permanent cheek implants which can be problematic as they sometimes cause infection or move, creating asymmetry in the face. Although fat can be used to transfer into the face and add volume, Restylane SubQ/ Juvederm Volumma injection are the only method available to achieve a similar result without the need for surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Restylane SubQ / Juvederm VOLUMA</strong> provides a non-surgical mid face lift. Whilst restoring volume in the skin in the upper half of the face to give a more youthful shape, it also diminishes the appearance of nose to mouth lines, to give a fresher look.</p>
<h4><strong>What is Restylane SubQ?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Restylane SubQ</strong> is hyaluronic acid specially formulated for facial contour and reshaping. Hyaluronic Acid is a substance that is found in the connective tissue of our skin and along with collagen forms the building blocks of healthy tissues. The gel in Restylane SubQ biodegrades naturally and safely over time. Restylane is the most popular facial filler in the world today and has been used in over 10 million treatments. It has a proven safety record.</p>
<h4><strong>What is Juverm Volumma?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Juvéderm Volumma</strong> is the latest generation of hyaluronic acid (HA) volumisers from Juvederm and is specifically developed to restore lost facial volume (e.g. in the cheeks, cheekbones, and chin). The product was developed to be a very smooth hyaluronic acid (HA) volumisers, making it easier to inject during treatment and resulting in a smooth, natural look and feel. The gel in Voluma is biodegraded naturally and safely over time, lasting 6-18 months after treatment. Juvéderm Volumma is demonstrated in clinical studies for its safety and a high level of satisfaction with the results of treatment.</p>
<p><strong>What does the procedure involve?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prior the treatment</strong>: The area is cleaned with antiseptic and marked using a marker pen to decide on the optimum site for enhancement. Numbing cream can be applied if patients prefer.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>: The new injection technique has allowed the treatment to be very comfortable and not even need any topical anesthetic. Juvederm VOLUMA/Restylane SubQ is slowly injected to place the filler above the cheek bone. Further product may be placed laterally in the cheek to further enhance the contour depending on the natural shape of your cheek.</p>
<p>The result is immediate and will last about up to 18 months. However, due to the immediate swelling from the procedure the final result will not be seen until about 3-4 weeks. A plan for regular follow-up treatments to maintain the initial result can be created for you. Our treatment provides a long-lasting but not permanent result leaving you the option of refining your treatment in tune with changing taste and fashion.</p>

</table>
<p>Post Treatment: avoid touching and applying make up for 6 hours after the treatment to prevent infection. It is advised to lie on your back for the first 2-3 nights to avoid pressure on the area.</p>
<p><strong>What is the recovery and when can I go back to work?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the effects of the injection it is be better to rest until the next day and you are advised to take some pain killers to prevent any discomfort for 1-2 days.</p>
<h4><strong>What are the risks?</strong></h4>
<p>The soft tissue fillers that demonstrate consistent safety for the last 20 years are the non-permanent fillers such as Restylane and Juvederm. As with any sort of injection there can be some bruising and minor swelling although this is not severe and usually settles within 2-3 days. There is rare chance of any allergic reaction which means no skin test is needed before treatment.</p>
