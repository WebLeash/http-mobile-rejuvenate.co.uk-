<h4>Sclerotherapy/ Leg Vein Removal</h4>
<p>Thread veins are largely inherited. They are also hormone related and can get worse in pregnancy and on hormone replacement therapy. They can also follow trauma leading to heavy bruising including surgery for varicose veins.</p>
<p>Rejuvenate Clinic offers sclerotherapy: a minimally invasive treatment that destroys the veins that are reabsorbed. As one of the UK’s leading cosmetic treatment centres we offer only the most advanced, effective treatment options.</p>
<p>It is almost painless. The veins may look worse for the first three weeks, but they fade over the next three months and improvement continues over a year. The development of new thread veins is inevitable but the results usually last for several years.</p>

<h4>How does the treatment work?</h4>
<p>A tiny needle is used to inject a sclerosing solution that damages the vein wall. The body recognises this and reabsorbs the vein, a process that takes a few weeks.</p>
<h4>How successful is Sclerotherapy?</h4>
<p>You can expect an improvement of at least 80% to 90% is usual for our patients get a good to very good result, 10-20% achieve a fair or reasonable improvement,whereby the veins fade, but do not disappear completely. Occasionally the veins clear completely.</p>
<h4>How effective is Sclerotherapy?</h4>
<p>The results achieved through sclerotherapy will be permanent, however sclerotherapy will not prevent the development of new veins. Yearly thread vein removal sessions may be recommended to maintain a clear complexion.</p>
<h4>How many treatment sessions are needed?</h4>
<p>The treatment is quite quick and all the veins can often be treated in a single 30 minute session. Uptake varies and a second session is sometimes needed a month later</p>
<p>.</p>
<h4>Will there be any complications?</h4>
<p>Treated veins often itch for a few hours afterwards. This confirms that the sclerosant has worked. Bruising can be expected for a couple of weeks. Larger veins may leave a coffee coloured stain which is still an improvement and usually fades after a few months. Very rarely a small ulcer can develop at the injection site. Allergic reaction to the sclerosant is extremely rare (about 1 in 100,000).</p>
<h4>What should I do before treatment?</h4>
<p>You should avoid anti-inflammatory drugs such as Aspirin and Ibuprofen for at least 10 days to reduce bruising. It is best not to oil your legs beforehand. It is advisable to wear trousers or a long skirt to your appointment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What happens afterwards?</strong></p>
<p>Cotton wool will be taped over the injection sites to protect your clothes. They can be removed the same evening. Wearing support tights or stockings is recommended for a few days afterwards.  It is not necessary to wear stockings to bed except for the first night following your procedure.Optimal results take up to 3 months so patience is needed as well as planning ahead before holidays in the sun. The final results of treatment will gradually develop over the course of several weeks. Scar tissue will form in the treated veins, causing them to collapse. The collapsed vein will eventually be reabsorbed into the surrounding tissue, fading from visibility. Several sclerotherapy sessions may be needed to achieve optimal results</p>
