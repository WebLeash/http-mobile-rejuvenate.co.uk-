<p>Unattractive skin lesions can often appear, despite the fact that the body does have a natural mechanism to safeguard the health of the skin. Removing skin lesions for both cosmetic reasons and medical necessity is an ever increasing need. Patients can now be treated quickly, safely and effectively.</p>
<p>Cryotherapy is the recognised procedure for the application of extreme cold to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue. With CryoPen, accuracy to the millimetre is achieved by simply pointing the micro-fine jet of cryogen onto the lesion.</p>
<p>With traditional methods for cryotherapy treatment, pain due to collateral damage is not easy to avoid. With CryoPen's pinpoint precision to the millimetre there's no more treatment of healthy tissue which avoids the pain associated with traditional methods.</p>
<p>Cryotherapy is a very useful treatment of warts, dermatofibrona, actinic keratosis, solar lentigo, seborrheic keratosis, skin tags etc. There's little to no preparation and no follow-up care necessary.</p>

<p>Wart treatment with cryotherapy , also verruca removal &amp; other skin lesions such as skin tags at Rejuvenate Clinic,Bradford.</p>
<p>Prices FROM £50 per treatment.</p>
<p>Cryotherapy involves freezing the lesion using liquid nitrogen at temperatures around -190C. Cryotherapy is a standard treatment for warts and other skin lesions. The liquid nitrogen application usually takes less than a minute. Once the warts have been exposed to the freezing effects of liquid nitrogen your immune response  may be kick started and even untreated warts and verrucas can disappear.</p>

<p>At Skinqure we use state of the art equipment that allows for the liquid nitrogen to be specifically targeted at the unwanted tissue, reducing pain and side effects. Out specialist flask can be fitted with a variety of different attachments which are appropriate for differing skin lesions.</p>
<p>We do NOT use a cryopen as these only temperatures of about – 70C and are not very effective. Our equipment works at temperatures of -196 C .</p>
<p>Carron has experience of using cryotherapy and uses the technology in his NHS and private clinics. It is increasingly difficult to get treatment for cosmetic lesions on the NHS. We can offer cryotherapy wart and skin lesion removal at our Rejuvenate clinics</p>

<p>Cryotherapy for wart , verruca and skin lesion removal FAQs</p>
<h4>What can it treat?</h4>
<p>Wart, verrucae, skin tags, small fleshy growths and similar small ‘lumps and bumps’ on the skin are ideal for liquid nitrogen treatment. (as above)</p>
<h4>Is it painful?</h4>
<p>Applications usually last about 10-30 seconds. Try holding a cube of ice against your skin for 10-30 seconds. It is uncomfortable but usually not too painful. Liquid nitrogen applied to skin is similar but colder and most people find the discomfort quite bearable.</p>
<h4>What can I expect?</h4>
<p>After a treatment, the lump, wart or whatever is being treated will gradually discolour and fall off. The surrounding skin will sometimes become red and swollen and be sore for a day or so. It is similar to a mild burn. Occasionally a blister (sometimes a ‘blood blister’) forms. If this happens, it is best to pop it with a clean pin and apply a plaster. New skin quickly forms and any scab or blister will soon disappear. The cosmetic result is usually good.</p>
<h4>Does it always work?</h4>
<p>Usually it does. However, sometimes thicker warts or verrucas need two or more sessions of liquid nitrogen treatment over a period of a few weeks to get to the root. Compared with other treatments, most people</p>
