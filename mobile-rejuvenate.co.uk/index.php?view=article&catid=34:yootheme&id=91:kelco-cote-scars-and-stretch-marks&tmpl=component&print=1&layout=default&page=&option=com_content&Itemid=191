<h2>Details</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Kelocote® - Advanced formula scar gel 15 g<br /> Recommended by Dermatologists and Plastic Surgeons, used by the NHS<br /> <br /> Kelocote® helps treat, reduce, prevent and soften scars, both old and new.<br /> Kelocote® is a patented topical silicone gel for the management and prevention of abnormal scars in the form of hypertrophic scars and keloids<br /> Kelocote® is the most effective scar treatment product on the market today and is the most cost effective. A very thin layer is applied, which means that it is the best value product currently sold for scars.<br /> <br /> Silicone is the clinical gold standard for scar treatment and scar prevention having demonstrated clinical efficacy over all other forms of topical treatments and is recommended by the “International Advisory Panel on Scar Management” as the first line therapy in the treatment of:<br /> <br /> •Linear Hypertrophic Scars <br /> •Keloids <br /> •Widespread Burn Hypertrophic Scars<br /> <br /> Kelo-cote® has also been successfully used to manage scars resulting from trauma, burns and surgery.<br /> <br /> 2 Weeks post surgical          12 Weeks post kelo-cote treatment<br /> <br /> Benefits:<br /> - Self dries to an invisible, breathable sheet with 4-5 minutes<br /> - Provides elastic protection<br /> - Transparent &amp; odourless silicone gel<br /> - Twice daily application<br /> - Reduces scar associated pain, itching and discolouration<br /> - Used on old and new scars<br /> - Cosmetics or sunblock can be used once the gel has dried.<br /> <br /> Directions:<br /> Kelo-cote is used to prevent, reduce, help and treat keloid and hypertrophic scars resulting from general or cosmetic surgery scars, injury or burns, acne scars, and pregnancy stretch marks scars.<br /> For best results apply Kelo-cote® twice daily (morning and evening) on clean dry skin for a duration of 60-90 days. Larger and older scars may take longer and continued use is recommended if improvement is still seen after the initial 90 days.<br /> Once dry, Kelo-cote® can be covered with pressure garments, sun block or cosmetics.<br /> Kelo-cote® must not be used on broken skin.<br /> <br /> Post laser/ chemical peel:<br /> Kelo-cote® has become the treatment of choice for post laser use and is especially effective in the reduction and elimination of erythema (redness) associated with dermatological laser procedures and chemical peels. <br /> Acne scars:<br /> Kelo-cote® has been used effectively for the treatment of scars resulting from acne and chickenpox. However, Kelo-cote® is not indicated for the use on active acne. <br /> After surgery:<br /> You can start to apply Kelo-cote after the any stitches have been removed and the wound is no longer bleeding.<br /> Infection:<br /> If an infection is present, have it treated prior to beginning your Kelo-cote treatment. Do not apply any other product underneath Kelo-cote. Applying medications on top of Kelo-cote will have no effect because, by design, it will not be able to pass through the Kelo-cote membrane.<br /> <strong><br /> </strong></p>
<p><br /> The Siliclear Complex™ is the foundation of Kelo-cote® scar treatment products; it refers to our patented combination of silicone ingredients including long chain polymer liquid, volatile, and solid silicones.  This precise formula, combined with a highly specialized manufacturing process, transforms these ingredients into our highly effective scar treatment gels and spray. The Siliclear Complex™ formulation enables the use of higher molecular weight, long chain polymers which will form a waterproof, semi-occlusive layer that adheres well to the surface of the skin. The volatile silicones allow for a spreadable consistency that will not damage the skin or cause pain during application. It is “smear proof” upon drying, and does not feel tacky or sticky to the touch. This silicone layer acts as a custom-fitted silicone sheet on the skin, providing all the benefits of silicone sheeting without the bulk, maceration or inconvenience.</p>

It also helps prevent stretch marks from forming with 75% of study participants agreeing, and helps reduce the appearance of existing stretch marks. <br /> <br /> Results<br /> Studies show a 30% average reduction in the width of existing stretch marks and; 60% of study participants experienced a reduction in existing stretch-marks. <br /> <br /> Size : 125ml<br /> <br /> How to use:<br /> Kelo-stretch should be gently massaged into skin twice a day during pregnancy for prevention of stretch marks, or applied twice a day for three months to reduce existing stretch marks. <br /> <br /> It can be used from the fourth month of pregnancy, and is suitable for breastfeeding mothers. Kelo-stretch is well tolerated with 100% of study participants reporting no irritation after three months of use, and is fragrance and paraben free.</p>
