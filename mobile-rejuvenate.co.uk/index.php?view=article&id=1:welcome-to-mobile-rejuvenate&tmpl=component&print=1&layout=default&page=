<p>I am a qualified Registered General Nurse with a BSc (Hons) degree in Nursing. I have been a nurse for more than 20 years, a Nurse Practitioner working at an advanced level and an Independent Nurse Prescriber. I have undergone extensive training given by Harley street plastic surgeons and Nurses in the industry via the companies who make the products, attending conferences and regular training programmes covering all areas of facial and body treatments. I have completed training in advanced injection techniques in Botulinum toxins, dermal fillers, cosmeceutical skin ranges and medical skin peels to master class standard. I have developed a passion for skin health and aim to achieve the best outcome for each client.</p>
<p>I have formed two companies entitled Rejuvenate and Confident smile.</p>
<p><br />Moreover, I have successfully completed the Certified Courses and I am now a qualified Aesthetic Nurse Prescribing Practitioner. I  am committed to keeping abreast of developments in the aesthetic field and attend regular updates in advanced techniques. I am continually assessing evidence based products and treatments available, to offer men and women, to improve skin health and maintain fresher, firmer skin, all of which have wonderful anti-ageing effects. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and the MHRA, closely monitor Aesthetic Nursing practice and currently advise now that nurses who are qualified in prescribing medicines can provide you with anti-wrinkle injections with Botox treatment product. Prescribing Nurses are governed by Medicines Management and NMC code of practice to maintain high evidence based standards of safe and quality practice. I am based in Bradford, West Yorkshire and offer a mobile service covering West Yorkshire and beyond.</p>
